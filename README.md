# Brick Braker

This is a C++ school project which aimed to recreate a popular brick braker game. It features three distinct difficulty levels in which bricks have different number of lives - some of them need to be hit several times to be destroyed. The number of lives is denoted using brick color, with yellow being just one live.
As visible in the gif below, collision logic introduces a bug where from time to time several bricks are destroyed all at once. This bug was left out in the code as it could be seen as a sudden power up feature.
